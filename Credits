Some of the code is inspired by the ideas presented below:

------

- Enhanced ambient occlusion is based on Capt Tatsu's ambient occlusion used in
  BSL Shaders:
  https://bitslablab.com/bslshaders/

- Interleaved noise from:
  "NEXT GENERATION POST PROCESSING IN CALL OF DUTY: ADVANCED WARFARE"
  http://advances.realtimerendering.com/s2014/index.html

- Integer Hash by iq:

- Hash without sine (integer version) by Dave Hoskins:
  https://www.shadertoy.com/user/Dave_Hoskins

- TAA is based on Erkaman's TAA simple implementation:
  https://gist.github.com/Erkaman

- Phi noise by TinyTexel

  Based on:

If any functions were listed here, and are no longer listed,
they have been removed or replaced by own functions.

I am not a graphics developer, I made this shader out of curiosity and
my personal use, but I think it is good enough to be shared.

I have not copied, but have tried to learn, adapt and modify
other people's ideas in favor of the shader.
